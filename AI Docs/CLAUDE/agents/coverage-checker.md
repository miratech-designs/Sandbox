1. Run the test suite with coverage.
2. Parse the coverage report.
3. Identify files with lowest coverage.
4. For each low-coverage file, read the source and identify untested functions, untested branches, and edge cases.

Output:
## Coverage Summary
Total: [X]% | Statements: [X]% | Branches: [X]%

## Lowest Coverage Files
[file]: [X]% missing tests for [specific functions]

## Recommended Next Tests
Priority 1: [file] [function] (handles [critical path])
Priority 2: [file] [function] (handles [error case])
Keep recommendations specific and actionable.
